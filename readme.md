# What is it
green-cards is basically a python project that creates a sequence of commits on random dates to generate green squares on github.

# How it works
basically it works by generating random dates within a set time interval and uses the **os** library to commit the date generated within the commits.yml file and at the same time be committed to that date through the ```--date parameter```, after all commits it push for the repository.

# How to use
you must fork the repository and clone from your profile, after that just run '''python app.py'''
